<u>**Mandatory technologies**</u>
- [x] Flutter
- [x] SQLite

<u>**Requirements**</u>
- [x] Only logged-in users can create tasks;

  - [x] Each record in the list should have actions (edit, delete, view, complete)
  - [x] The complete action should only be for open tasks (not completed), and should request confirmation to complete a task;
  - [x] It should request confirmation for the user to delete a task;
  - [x] Task creation should have the fields (name, due date, completion date);
  - [x] The name and due date fields are mandatory, others are optional;
  - [x] Each logged-in user should only see their own tasks;
